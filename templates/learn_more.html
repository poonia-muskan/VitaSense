      <h3>What is Cancer?</h3>
      <p>
      Cancer is not just a disease — it’s a disruption of nature’s rhythm inside the human body. It’s when the harmony of healthy cell growth breaks down, and chaos begins to bloom silently. It starts with a single cell, quietly defying the rules, multiplying recklessly — like a rebel in a peaceful kingdom — until it threatens the entire system it once belonged to. <br>
      At its core, cancer is a genetic disease, meaning it’s caused by changes (mutations) in the DNA within cells. DNA is the instruction manual that tells a cell how to grow, divide, and die. But when these instructions get corrupted, either by internal mistakes or external triggers (like smoking, radiation, infections, etc.), the cell no longer follows the natural plan. It starts dividing uncontrollably. These rogue cells do not die when they should. Instead, they build up, forming tumors, or in some cases (like in blood cancers), they flood the bloodstream.
      </p>

      <h3>Common Types of Cancer</h3>
      <h4>Breast Cancer</h4>
      <p>Breast cancer is a disease in which the cells of the breast grow uncontrollably and form a malignant tumor. These tumors can start in different parts of the breast — the lobules (milk-producing glands), ducts (milk-carrying passages), or sometimes in the fatty and connective tissues. <br>
         It most commonly affects women, but men can also develop breast cancer, though it’s much rarer in them.<br>
         In breast cancer, the abnormal cells not only multiply rapidly, but they can also invade surrounding tissues and, in advanced stages, spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body like the bones, liver, lungs, or brain.
      </p>
      <h4>Lung Cancer</h4>
         <p>Lung cancer is a serious disease where abnormal cells in the lungs grow uncontrollably, often forming tumors that interfere with breathing. 
          It’s one of the most common and deadliest cancers worldwide, mainly caused by smoking, but it can also affect non-smokers due to pollution, exposure to harmful substances like asbestos or radon, and genetic factors.<br>
          Symptoms usually appear late and may include a persistent cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, and unexplained weight loss. 
          It’s mainly classified into non-small cell and small cell types. Treatment depends on the stage and may involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, targeted drugs, or immunotherapy. Early detection is key to increasing survival chances.
         </p>
      <h4>Colon Cancer</h4>
         <p>Colon cancer, also known as colorectal cancer when it includes the rectum, begins in the large intestine (colon), usually as small, noncancerous growths called polyps. Over time, some of these polyps can turn into cancer. It often develops silently, especially in the early stages, but later symptoms may include changes in bowel habits, blood in stool, abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, and fatigue. It affects both men and women, typically over age 50, but can also occur in younger adults.<br>
          Risk factors include low-fiber diets, smoking, alcohol, family history, and inflammatory bowel disease. Colon cancer is treatable, especially if caught early, through surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapy. Regular screening like colonoscopy can detect and remove polyps before they become dangerous — making awareness and early detection absolutely life-saving.   
         </p>
      <h4>Skin Cancer</h4>
          <p>Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer, and it begins in the skin’s outer layer due to the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells. It’s often caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun or tanning beds. There are three main types: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and the most dangerous form, melanoma.<br>
            Early signs include new moles, changes in existing moles, or sores that don’t heal. Watch for moles that are asymmetrical, have irregular borders, uneven coloring, or grow in size. Skin cancer is usually very treatable when caught early, often through surgery, cryotherapy, or radiation. Wearing sunscreen, avoiding tanning, and doing regular skin checks are simple ways to protect yourself.
          </p>
      <h4>Stomach Cancer</h4>
          <p>Stomach cancer, also called gastric cancer, begins in the lining of the stomach and usually develops slowly over many years. It’s often linked to long-term inflammation, H. pylori infection, smoking, poor diet, and sometimes family history. Early-stage stomach cancer often shows no symptoms, which makes it hard to detect early. As it grows, it may cause indigestion, bloating, nausea, loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss, stomach pain, or vomiting blood.<br>
            Diagnosis usually involves endoscopy, biopsy, and imaging scans. Treatment depends on the stage and may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or targeted therapy. Since early signs can be subtle, awareness and timely medical attention are key to improving outcomes.
          </p>
      <h4>Liver Cancer</h4>
          <p>Liver cancer begins in the cells of the liver, with the most common type being hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It often develops in people with chronic liver damage, especially from hepatitis B or C infections, alcohol abuse, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In early stages, liver cancer may not cause symptoms, but as it progresses, signs can include upper abdominal pain, swelling, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), and loss of appetite.<br>
            Diagnosis involves blood tests, imaging scans, and biopsy. Treatment may include surgery, liver transplant, targeted drugs, or radiation therapy, depending on the cancer’s size, stage, and liver function. Preventing liver infections, limiting alcohol, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can lower the risk.
          </p>
      <h4>Prostate Cancer</h4>
          <p>Prostate cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the prostate gland, a small walnut-shaped gland in men that produces seminal fluid. It’s one of the most common cancers in men, especially those over 50. Often slow-growing, early-stage prostate cancer may not show any symptoms, which is why regular screening is important. When symptoms do appear, they may include frequent urination, especially at night, weak or interrupted urine flow, blood in urine or semen, and sometimes pain during ejaculation or in the lower back.<br>
            Diagnosis is done through PSA blood tests, digital rectal exams (DRE), and biopsy. Treatment depends on the stage and may include active surveillance, surgery, radiation, hormone therapy, or chemotherapy. With early detection, prostate cancer is highly treatable and often curable.
          </p>
      <h4>Cervix Cancer</h4>
          <p>Cervical cancer begins in the cells of the cervix, the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. It’s most commonly caused by a long-term infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV), a very common sexually transmitted virus. In its early stages, cervical cancer often has no symptoms, which makes regular Pap smears and HPV tests essential for early detection.<br>
            As it progresses, symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding (especially after intercourse), unusual discharge, pelvic pain, and pain during sex. It’s highly preventable through HPV vaccination, routine screening, and timely treatment. When detected early, cervical cancer is one of the most successfully treatable forms of cancer.
          </p>
      <h4>Blood Cancer</h4>
          <p>Leukemia is a type of blood cancer that begins in the bone marrow, where blood cells are made. It causes the body to produce abnormal white blood cells that don’t function properly and crowd out healthy blood cells. This weakens the immune system and disrupts normal blood functions. Leukemia can appear suddenly (acute) or progress slowly (chronic), and it affects both children and adults.<br>
            Symptoms may include frequent infections, fatigue, easy bruising or bleeding, bone or joint pain, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. Diagnosis is made through blood tests, bone marrow biopsy, and genetic testing. Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, and bone marrow transplant. With early diagnosis and the right care, many types of leukemia are treatable, and some are even curable.
          </p>
      <h4>Esophageal Cancer</h4>
          <p>Esophageal cancer starts in the esophagus, the long, hollow tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach. It usually begins in the inner lining of the esophagus and can grow to block swallowing or spread to nearby organs. The two main types are adenocarcinoma (common in the lower esophagus) and squamous cell carcinoma (more common in the upper part). Major risk factors include smoking, heavy alcohol use, acid reflux (GERD), obesity, and a condition called Barrett’s esophagus.<br>
            Symptoms often appear late and include difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), chest pain, heartburn, unintended weight loss, and sometimes vomiting blood. Diagnosis is done through endoscopy, biopsy, and imaging scans. Treatment may involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or targeted therapy, depending on the stage. Early detection is tough but key — so persistent swallowing issues should never be ignored.
          </p>
      <h4>Kidney Cancer</h4>
          <p>Kidney cancer begins in the tissues of the kidneys, the bean-shaped organs that filter waste from the blood and produce urine. The most common type is renal cell carcinoma, usually found in adults. Kidney cancer often develops quietly, with no symptoms in early stages, but as it grows, it may cause blood in the urine, lower back or side pain, a lump or mass near the kidneys, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, or fever that comes and goes.<br>
            Risk factors include smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, family history, and exposure to harmful chemicals. It’s typically diagnosed through imaging scans and confirmed with a biopsy. Treatment may involve surgery, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or radiation, depending on the size and spread. Early detection offers a strong chance of recovery.
          </p>
      <h4>Bladder Cancer</h4>
          <p>Bladder cancer starts in the lining of the bladder, the organ that stores urine. It most commonly affects older adults and is more common in men than women. The main type is transitional cell carcinoma, though other forms also exist. One of the earliest and most noticeable symptoms is blood in the urine (hematuria), which may appear pink, red, or cola-colored. Other symptoms include painful urination, frequent urges to pee, or lower back pain.<br>
            Risk factors include smoking, exposure to certain industrial chemicals, chronic bladder infections, and family history. Diagnosis is typically done with urine tests, cystoscopy, and imaging scans. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and sometimes bladder removal in advanced cases. Early detection greatly improves the chance of successful treatment.
          </p>
      <h4>Brain Cancer</h4>
          <p>Brain cancer occurs when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably in the brain tissues, forming tumors that can interfere with how the brain controls the body. Some brain tumors are benign (non-cancerous), while others are malignant (cancerous) and can spread within the brain or spinal cord. Brain cancer can either start in the brain (primary) or spread from other organs (secondary or metastatic).<br>
            Symptoms vary depending on the tumor’s size and location but often include persistent headaches, seizures, vision or hearing problems, memory loss, confusion, personality changes, difficulty speaking, or loss of balance and coordination. It’s diagnosed through MRI or CT scans, followed by a biopsy. Treatment may involve surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy. Brain cancer can be especially challenging due to the sensitivity of the brain, but with early detection and modern treatment, some forms can be managed or even cured.
          </p>
      <h4>Thyroid Cancer</h4>
          <p>Thyroid cancer begins in the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped gland at the base of the neck that helps regulate metabolism, heart rate, and body temperature through hormone production. It’s often slow-growing and may not show symptoms in the early stages. When symptoms do appear, they can include a lump or swelling in the neck, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, neck or throat pain, and swollen lymph nodes.<br>
            The most common types are papillary and follicular thyroid cancer, both of which usually have a good prognosis. Risk factors include radiation exposure, family history, and certain genetic conditions. Diagnosis involves ultrasound, thyroid function tests, and a biopsy. Treatment typically includes surgery, radioactive iodine therapy, and sometimes thyroid hormone therapy. Most thyroid cancers are highly treatable, especially when detected early.
          </p>
      <h4>Pancreas Cancer</h4>
          <p>Pancreatic cancer begins in the pancreas, an organ behind the stomach that helps with digestion and blood sugar control. It’s one of the most aggressive and hard-to-detect cancers because early symptoms are often vague or absent. As it grows, it may cause abdominal or back pain, unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), nausea, and fatigue.<br>
            The most common type is pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which starts in the ducts of the pancreas. Risk factors include smoking, chronic pancreatitis, diabetes, family history, and obesity. Diagnosis involves imaging tests, blood markers (like CA 19-9), and biopsy. Treatment is often challenging and may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or targeted therapy, depending on the stage. Due to its silent nature, early detection is rare but crucial for better outcomes.
          </p>

      <h3>Other Types of Cancers</h3>
          <p>Beyond the more commonly known cancers, there are several other types that affect different organs and systems in the body, each with its own symptoms, risks, and treatments.<br>
            Ovarian cancer, for example, develops in the ovaries and is often called a “silent killer” because early symptoms like bloating, pelvic pain, or changes in appetite are easily overlooked.<br>
            Uterine (endometrial) cancer affects the lining of the uterus and often causes abnormal vaginal bleeding.<br>
            Testicular cancer typically strikes younger men and usually shows up as a painless lump or swelling in the testicles.<br>
            Bone cancer can be primary (starting in the bone) or secondary (spread from other cancers), with pain and swelling as early symptoms.<br>
            Laryngeal (throat) cancer affects the voice box and may cause hoarseness, sore throat, or difficulty swallowing.<br>
            Gallbladder cancer, though rare, is aggressive and often found late.<br>
            Eye cancer (ocular melanoma) affects vision and may cause changes in the appearance of the eye or vision loss.<br>
            Sarcomas are rare cancers that begin in the body's connective tissues — like muscles, fat, or blood vessels — and can occur almost anywhere.<br>
            <br>Each of these cancers might be rare, but they matter just as much. They show how cancer can touch nearly every part of the body — and remind us why awareness, routine checkups, and listening to our bodies are so important. If you want a full chart or poster-style list of all body-part-based cancers, I’d love to make it for you!

      <h3>Common Myths About Cancer</h3>
          <p>Myth: Cancer is always a death sentence.<br>
            Truth: Not at all! Many cancers are curable if detected early. Even advanced-stage cancers can be managed for years with treatment. Survival rates have improved thanks to modern medicine, targeted therapies, and early diagnosis.<br>
            <br>Myth: Only smokers get cancer.<br>
            Truth: While smoking is a major risk factor (especially for lung cancer), non-smokers can also get cancer due to genetics, pollution, infections (like HPV), lifestyle, or pure chance.<br>
            <br>Myth: Cancer is contagious.<br>
            Truth: No! You can’t “catch” cancer from someone. It’s not a virus or bacteria. However, some infections (like HPV or hepatitis) can increase the risk of developing cancer — but the cancer itself isn’t contagious.<br>
            <br>Myth: Cancer always causes pain.<br>
            Truth: This is a long-standing myth with no scientific backing. Biopsies and surgeries are vital for diagnosis and treatment. Doctors follow strict protocols to prevent any spread.<br>
            <br>Myth: Cancer is caused by a bad diet or stress alone.<br>
            Truth: Diet and stress can influence your overall health, but they don’t directly cause cancer. Cancer usually results from a complex mix of genetics, environment, and lifestyle over time.<br>
            <br>Myth: Young people don’t get cancer.<br>
            Truth: While cancer is more common with age, it can affect children, teens, and young adults too. Leukemia, bone cancer, and thyroid cancer are examples seen in younger people.<br>
            <br>Myth: Natural remedies can cure cancer.<br>
            Truth: Be careful! While some natural remedies can support wellness, there’s no scientific evidence that they can cure cancer. Only evidence-based treatments like chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery have proven effectiveness. Always consult a doctor.<br>
            <br>Myth: If no one in my family had cancer, I won’t get it.<br>
            Truth: Most cancers are not inherited. In fact, only about 5–10% of cancers are linked to genetics. Anyone can develop cancer, even without family history.<br>
            <br>Myth: Cancer treatment is worse than the disease.<br>
            Truth: Treatments can be intense, but they save lives. Side effects are manageable, and newer therapies are far more targeted and gentle than in the past. Many people live long, happy, and healthy lives post-treatment.<br>
      <br><h5>"This is not the end of our story. It’s just a chapter, a pause, a check-in. Our strength is bigger than any symptom, Our courage louder than any fear.  Hope isn’t about ignoring what could be wrong; it’s about believing in what can still go right."</h5>
